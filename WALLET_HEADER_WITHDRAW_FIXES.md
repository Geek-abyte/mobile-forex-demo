# Wallet Header & Withdraw Screen Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WalletScreen Header Not Visible
**Problem**: The WalletScreen header was not appearing even though StandardHeader was implemented.

**Root Cause**: There were two WalletScreen.tsx files in the project:
- `/src/screens/main/WalletScreen.tsx` (with StandardHeader implemented)
- `/src/screens/wallet/WalletScreen.tsx` (old version without StandardHeader)

The MainNavigator was importing from the wrong location (`../screens/wallet/WalletScreen`) instead of the correct one with StandardHeader.

**Solution**:
1. Updated MainNavigator.tsx to import WalletScreen from the correct location: `../screens/main/WalletScreen`
2. Removed the duplicate/outdated WalletScreen.tsx from the wallet directory
3. Confirmed the main WalletScreen has proper StandardHeader implementation

### 2. WithdrawScreen Style Issues
**Problem**: WithdrawScreen had old unused header styles and inconsistent styling.

**Solution**:
1. Removed unused header-related styles (`header`, `backButton`, `headerTitle`, `headerRight`) since StandardHeader is now used
2. Cleaned up the styles object to remove redundant code
3. Maintained all existing functionality and styling while removing dead code

## Files Modified

### Updated
- `/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx` - Fixed import path for WalletScreen
- `/src/screens/wallet/WithdrawScreen.tsx` - Cleaned up unused header styles

### Removed
- `/src/screens/wallet/WalletScreen.tsx` - Duplicate/outdated file

## Verification

1. ✅ WalletScreen now properly displays StandardHeader
2. ✅ WithdrawScreen styles cleaned up with no compilation errors
3. ✅ All navigation imports corrected
4. ✅ No duplicate files remaining
5. ✅ Build runs successfully without errors

## Key Changes Made

### MainNavigator.tsx
```typescript
// Changed from:
import WalletScreen from '../screens/wallet/WalletScreen';

// To:
import WalletScreen from '../screens/main/WalletScreen';
```

### WithdrawScreen.tsx
- Removed unused header-related styles
- Kept all functional styles intact
- Maintained StandardHeader usage

## Result

- ✅ WalletScreen now has a visible, consistent header matching other main screens
- ✅ WithdrawScreen maintains all functionality with cleaner, more maintainable styles
- ✅ No style or layout issues in either screen
- ✅ Consistent header styling across all major screens

Both screens now properly use the StandardHeader component and have clean, consistent styling.
