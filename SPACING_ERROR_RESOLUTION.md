# Spacing Theme Error Resolution

## Problem
The app was showing a runtime error: "ReferenceError: Property 'spacing' doesn't exist". This was occurring because several components were using theme properties like `spacing`, `colors`, and `typography` without properly importing or destructuring them from the theme.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the theme import patterns. Some files were:
1. Using `import theme from '../../theme'` but then trying to access `spacing` directly in StyleSheet without destructuring
2. Importing only some theme properties but using others in the styles

## Files Fixed

### 1. ChartScreen.tsx
**Issue**: Using `spacing`, `colors`, `typography` directly in styles without proper destructuring
**Fix**: Added theme destructuring before StyleSheet:
```typescript
const { colors, spacing, typography, shadows } = theme;
```

### 2. ProfessionalTradingChart.tsx
**Issues**: 
- Only importing `colors` but using `spacing` and `typography` in styles
- Missing React Native component imports (Text, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView)
- Missing Reanimated imports (useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withTiming)
- Missing chart library imports (CandlestickChart, LineChart)
- Missing icon imports (Ionicons)

**Fix**: Updated imports to include all needed dependencies:
```typescript
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView, StyleSheet, Dimensions, Platform } from 'react-native';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';
import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { CandlestickChart, LineChart } from 'react-native-wagmi-charts';
import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons';
import { colors, spacing, typography } from '../../theme';
```

## Files Already Correct
The following files already had proper theme imports and didn't require changes:
- `P2PScreen.tsx`
- `ProfileScreen.tsx` 
- `OrderScreen.tsx`

## Theme Import Patterns

### ✅ Correct Patterns:
```typescript
// Pattern 1: Named imports (preferred)
import { colors, spacing, typography } from '../../theme';

// Pattern 2: Default import with destructuring
import theme from '../../theme';
const { colors, spacing, typography } = theme;
```

### ❌ Incorrect Patterns:
```typescript
// This will cause runtime errors if spacing is used in styles
import theme from '../../theme';
// then using spacing[4] directly in StyleSheet without destructuring
```

## Verification
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Runtime "spacing doesn't exist" error should be resolved
- Expo development server started successfully

## Dependencies Added
The ProfessionalTradingChart component relies on several libraries that should be installed:
- `react-native-reanimated`
- `react-native-wagmi-charts`
- `@expo/vector-icons`

These are likely already installed but if there are runtime issues, verify these packages are properly installed.
