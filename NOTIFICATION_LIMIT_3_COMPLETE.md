# Notification Simulation Limit - 3 Notifications Maximum

## Changes Made

### Issue
The notification simulation was potentially showing more than 3 notifications during the demo experience.

### Solution
Updated the notification system to strictly limit demo notifications to exactly 3 notifications total:

1. **Welcome notification** - shown immediately upon login
2. **Account update notification** - shown after 8 seconds  
3. **One trading notification** - shown after 16 seconds (random trading event)

### Files Modified

#### `/src/services/notificationIntegration.ts`
- Completely redesigned `startDemoNotifications()` method
- Removed the separate trading simulation call
- Manually scheduled exactly 3 notifications with specific timing
- Added clear logging to confirm exactly 3 notifications are shown

#### `/src/services/notificationService.ts`
- Updated `startTradingSimulation()` method with stricter controls
- Added better logging to track notification count
- Ensured simulation stops exactly after the specified limit
- Added immediate first notification followed by spaced intervals

## Key Improvements

### Strict Counting
- **Before**: Multiple overlapping simulation systems could generate unlimited notifications
- **After**: Exactly 3 notifications are scheduled with precise timing and counting

### Clear Timeline
1. **T+0 seconds**: Welcome notification
2. **T+8 seconds**: Account ready notification  
3. **T+16 seconds**: One random trading notification (market movement, trade execution, or price alert)

### Improved Logging
- Console logs track exactly how many notifications are shown
- Clear confirmation when the demo notification sequence is complete

### No Overlapping Systems
- Removed the separate trading simulation interval system
- Single controlled sequence ensures no additional notifications can be generated

## Result

Users will now see exactly 3 notifications during the demo experience:
- ✅ Welcome message upon login
- ✅ Account status update 
- ✅ One example trading notification

No additional notifications will be generated, providing a clean, controlled demonstration of the notification system without overwhelming the user.
