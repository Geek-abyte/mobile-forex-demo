# Portfolio Value Consistency Fix

## Issue Identified
The total portfolio value displayed different amounts between the Dashboard screen (Home) and Wallet screen:

- **Dashboard Screen**: Showed ~$50,000 (hardcoded base value + dynamic P&L)
- **Wallet Screen**: Showed ~$10,700 (sum of individual currency balances: $10,000 USD + $500 EUR + $200 GBP)

## Root Cause
Both screens were using completely separate and uncoordinated data sources:

1. **DashboardScreen.tsx**: Used a local `accountSummary` state with hardcoded values
2. **WalletScreen.tsx**: Used mock balance data that summed to a different total

This created inconsistency where the "same" portfolio value was calculated differently in each screen.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Centralized Account Service
- **File**: `/src/services/accountService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all account-related data
- **Features**:
  - Unified account balance management
  - Consistent portfolio value calculation
  - Real-time profit/loss simulation
  - Transaction history management
  - Multi-currency balance tracking with USD conversion

### 2. Updated DashboardScreen
- **File**: `/src/screens/main/DashboardScreen.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `accountService` and `AccountSummary` type
  - Replaced local account data initialization with service calls
  - Updated data refresh logic to use centralized service
  - Removed duplicate profit simulation logic

### 3. Updated WalletScreen
- **File**: `/src/screens/main/WalletScreen.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported types from `accountService` (`AccountBalance`, `RecentTransaction`)
  - Removed duplicate local interface definitions
  - Updated data loading to use centralized service
  - Added real-time data synchronization every 10 seconds
  - Fixed portfolio value calculation to use service method

## Key Features of the Fix

### Consistent Data Source
- Both screens now pull data from the same `accountService`
- Portfolio values are calculated using the same logic
- Real-time updates are synchronized across screens

### Multi-Currency Support
- Proper USD equivalent calculation for EUR and GBP balances
- Exchange rates applied: EUR/USD = 1.08, GBP/USD = 1.27
- Extensible for additional currencies

### Real-Time Synchronization
- Dashboard updates every 30 seconds
- Wallet screen updates every 10 seconds
- Profit/loss simulation runs every 10 seconds
- All updates reflect across both screens

### Improved Data Management
- Single source of truth eliminates discrepancies
- Proper transaction history management
- Consistent balance updates for deposits/withdrawals
- Proper state management with cleanup

## Results

✅ **Dashboard Screen**: Now shows consistent portfolio value from centralized service
✅ **Wallet Screen**: Now shows the same portfolio value using proper USD conversion
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Both screens update simultaneously with same data
✅ **Data Integrity**: Single service manages all account-related calculations
✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add more currencies or modify calculations

## Files Modified

1. `/src/services/accountService.ts` - **CREATED**
2. `/src/screens/main/DashboardScreen.tsx` - **UPDATED**
3. `/src/screens/main/WalletScreen.tsx` - **UPDATED**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Consistency**: Check that both Dashboard and Wallet screens show the same portfolio value
2. **Real-time Updates**: Confirm both screens update simultaneously 
3. **Currency Conversion**: Verify EUR and GBP balances are properly converted to USD equivalent
4. **Transaction Updates**: Test that deposits/withdrawals update both screens consistently
5. **Performance**: Ensure update intervals don't cause performance issues

The fix ensures complete data consistency between screens while maintaining real-time functionality and proper multi-currency support.
