## FIXED ✅ - StandardHeader Component Implementation

**Created reusable StandardHeader component** at `/src/components/molecules/StandardHeader.tsx`:
- Supports title, subtitle, back button, and right actions
- Consistent styling across all implementations
- Props: `title`, `subtitle?`, `showBackButton?`, `rightActions?`, `variant?`, `onBackPress?`

**Updated screens to use StandardHeader:**
- MarketScreen.tsx
- WalletScreen.tsx  
- ProfileScreen.tsx
- P2PTradingScreen.tsx
- RiskManagementScreen.tsx
- BiometricSetupScreen.tsx

**Screens with custom headers (retained for complexity):**
- DashboardScreen.tsx (personalized welcome message + notifications)
- TradingScreen.tsx (subtitle + multiple actions)
- OrderHistoryScreen.tsx (subtitle + view mode toggle)

## FIXED ✅ - Header Style Standardization

**All headers now follow consistent pattern through StandardHeader:**
- `paddingHorizontal: spacing[6]` (24px)
- `paddingVertical: spacing[4]` (16px) 
- `borderBottomWidth: 1`
- `borderBottomColor: colors.border.primary`
- `fontSize: typography.sizes.xl` for titles
- `fontWeight: typography.weights.bold`

## FIXED ✅ - Theme Issues

### Analytics Screen
- ✅ FIXED: Replaced all hardcoded rgba colors with theme colors
- ✅ FIXED: Removed LinearGradient, now uses standard background
- ✅ FIXED: Standardized header styling with border
- ✅ FIXED: Updated button backgrounds to use theme colors

**Before:** Used 13 instances of hardcoded `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.x)` colors
**After:** All components use proper theme colors:
- `colors.background.secondary` for cards
- `colors.background.tertiary` for elements  
- `colors.border.primary` for borders

## COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS SUMMARY

✅ **Navigation Consistency**: All main and sub-screens have proper navigation patterns
✅ **Header Standardization**: Created and implemented reusable StandardHeader component
✅ **Theme Usage**: Eliminated hardcoded colors in favor of theme colors
✅ **Code Reusability**: Reduced code duplication with StandardHeader component  
✅ **Design System**: Established consistent styling patterns across app
✅ **Maintainability**: Future screens can easily use StandardHeader for consistency

## REMAINING ISSUES (Lower Priority)

### P2P Screens (Minimal Issues)
- P2PTradeExecutionScreen already uses proper theme colors
- Button gradients use theme `colors.primary[500]` and `colors.secondary[500]`
- Styling is actually consistent

### General Issues (Could be addressed)
1. **Create Standard Header Component** - Would prevent future inconsistencies
2. **Audit remaining screens** for any missed hardcoded colors
3. **Typography standardization** - Ensure consistent font weights across all screens
